# kdrama-clustering-recommendations
A Python-based project that clusters K-Dramas using KMeans and hierarchical clustering based on ratings and number of episodes. The project also implements a Q-learning algorithm to recommend K-Dramas from different clusters, providing personalized recommendations for Moderately Rated, Lower Rated, and Highly Rated dramas.

**Features**

         1. Clustering: KMeans and Hierarchical Clustering of K-Dramas based on selected features.
         
         2.Q-Learning: Generates recommendations using a reinforcement learning approach.
         
         3.Visualization: Displays cluster results and dendrograms for easy interpretation.

**How to Run**

           Load your dataset in CSV format 
           
           Ensure the dataset has relevant features such as Rating and Number of Episodes.
           
           Run the script to visualize clustering and get recommendations based on user input.
